##### For *THIS LAST TIME WILL BE THE FIRST* (Finalist for the 2013 Burnside Review Press Book Award, subsequently published by Burnside Review in 2014):

“Immensely fresh and playful…rooted in a childlike antiquity.”—[Rain Taxi]() (print; Winter 2014 issue)

The poems in *This Last Time Will Be The First* are imaginative, enigmatic and inviting.—[The Volta](https://thevoltablog.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/this-last-time-will-be-the-first-by-jeff-alessandrelli/)

Although from section to section *This Last Time Will Be The First* shifts considerably in tone, intent and voice (the book’s Acknowledgments section lists two separate chapbook publications), it’s definitely a collection of poems doing something different, especially when compared to the work of a lot of other younger poets. Alessandrelli’s poetry has predecessors, certainly. But it bravely wears its influences on its sleeves, and somehow feels original as a result.—[Coldfront Mag](http://coldfrontmag.com/reviews/this-last-time-will-be-the-first-by-jeff-alessandrelli/)

Alessandrelli’s poetry… provides its reader with an interesting thought angle, one contemporarily fresh. *This Last Time Will Be The First*… is a collection worth wrestling with. And checking out.—[The Rumpus](http://therumpus.net/2014/08/this-last-time-will-be-the-first-by-jeff-alessandrelli/)

*This Last Time Will Be The First* deserves a moment in the spotlight, and a lifetime of reading. So, thank you Jeff Alessandrelli, for your words, and for making us feel like we’re not alone in our thoughts.—[The Poetry Question](https://thepoetryquestion.com/2014/06/10/review-jeff-alessandrelli-this-last-time-will-be-the-first/)

*THIS LAST TIME WILL BE THE FIRST* is an entertaining, insightful book of poems that refuses to settle and embodies a restless, self-conscious pursuit of how a poem both knows and doesn’t know.—[American Microreviews](http://www.americanmicroreviews.com/this-last-time-will-be-the-first-jeff-alessandrelli/)

In *THIS LAST TIME WILL BE THE FIRST*, Jeff Alessandrelli does a beautiful job using others’ lines and styles as a jumping-off point for his own poems. And though they are homages, they are always totally surprising, and totally his. They are not a game. Alessandrelli is a real human being, unlike the authors of some other poetry books you might be considering right now. Put them down. They do not, underneath their stylistic pyrotechnics, have a beating heart.”—Matthew Rohrer

"Jeff Alessandrelli writes, ‘I am squinting into the faint radiance / of the sun, its light / trying to shine’—*This Last Time Will Be the First* is full of resolutely flickering light. These poems are at work with Emerson’s idea that, ‘A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.’ The mind at work in these poems is not little. It is expansive, it is growing, it is looking to love.”—Emily Pettit

##### For *Erik Satie Watusies His Way Into Sound* (Poetic biography of the French avant-garde composer Erik Satie, published by Ravenna Press in 2011):

A lot is packed into this slim volume of poems, but it doesn’t feel weighed down by its focused subject. It’s clear that a lot of research went into the book, but the poems sprawl, connect, and open up in ways that allow readers to enjoy them on their own. While the poems may be focused on Satie, they are ultimately ontological in nature—searching for answers and understanding but ultimately returning to that *nothing, nothing, nothing and nothing*.—[New Pages](https://www.newpages.com/item/3608-erik-satie-watusies-his-way-into-sound)

…\[W\]e can consider the identity manipulation in [*Erik Satie Watusies His Way Into Sound*](http://www.ravennapress.com/books/title.php?tid=10029) a love letter between two artists. Of course, “We love those best who we fleetingly / recognize and can just as quickly forget”, so it should come as no surprise that after recognizing Satie in himself and himself in Satie, Alessandrelli demands that we “Forget forget Erik Satie.” Once we forget him, he “is nowhere / to be found,” but we can take comfort in the fact that “Someone we can’t remember // once played such haunting music / on a broken piano // he dreamed was an” author writing poems about Erik Satie and what it means to be Jeff Alessandrelli.—[HTML Giant](http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/erik-satie-watusies-his-way-into-sound/)

Satie’s compositions transmit the sensation of speaking, and these poems are a great letter inside that speech, a musical philology, speech wrested from rests.—Arda Collins

##### For *Don’t Let Me Forget to Feed the Sharks* (Chapbook published by the small press Poor Claudia in 2012):

If you’re into handsome books of fun poems, I highly recommend *Don’t Let Me Forget to Feed the Sharks*—[Lit Pub](https://thelitpub.com/theres-no-time-for-pleasantries-these-are-perilous-waters/)

Personal letter from Nick Admussen about *Don’t Let Me Forget To Feed the Sharks*—[Horse Less Press](https://horselesspress.org/reviews-interviews/nick-admussen-to-jeff-alessandrelli/)

##### For *People Are Places Are Places Are People* (Chapbook published by Imaginary Friend Press in 2013):

“I know that the sun is a byproduct/ of an infinitude of marigolds/and pure supple honey,/ but I don’t believe it,” Alessandrelli writes in “It’s the Things You Know that Are Hardest to Believe.” It’s as if a poetic truth can be believed into being, but once it exists, it no longer relies on the believer.—Cutbank
